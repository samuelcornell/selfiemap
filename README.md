[The visualization can be found here.](https://samuelcornell.github.io/selfiemap/source/index.html)

This map is evolving as new cases arises. There is a particular focus on those cases in Australia, at aquatic locations. It is not intended to be a comprehensive list or database of every selfie related event in the world. Nevertheless, it provides a geographical snapshot and highlights the issue. 

# Project Description

### Project Data Sources

1. News sites

## Inspiration

I am interested in mapping selfie incidents in Australia.

## What it does

This embryonic project is an interactive visualization that updates with every user scroll. It leverages the power of the scrollama library (JavaScript) and the MapBox API, with data pulled from news reports. 

## Who built it

This map/site is completely based on the work completed by Connor Rothschild and Denizhan-Yigitbas who created their project to map homicides in Houston. I have completely copied their code to learn how to use Mapbox.
