**The map is not optimised for mobile phone viewing, and is best viewed on a computer.**

This map is evolving as new cases arises. It includes cases of reported misadventure in the natural environment which lead to death or injury and are attributed to taking selfies or social media-related activity. There is a particular focus on those cases in Australia, at aquatic locations. It is not intended to be a comprehensive list or database of every selfie-related event in the world. Nevertheless, it provides a geographical snapshot and highlights the scale of the issue, globally and in Australia. Of note, the media may report that a case was social media-related when in fact it isn't, and vice versa. This is a challenging aspect of this kind of research.

# Project Description

### Project Data Sources

1. News sites
2. Peer reviewed literature

## Inspiration

I am interested in mapping selfie and social media-related incidents in Australia.

## What it does

This project is an interactive visualisation that updates with every user scroll. It leverages the power of the scrollama library (JavaScript) and the MapBox API, with data pulled from news reports. 

## Who built it

Samuel Cornell built this map and visualisation. This map and site is based on the work completed by Connor Rothschild and Denizhan-Yigitbas who created their project to map homicides in Houston.
